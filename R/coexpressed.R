# function to find co-expressed genes in normalized data from Seurat object
# it uses correlatePairs from scran to calculate correlations in expression between gene pairs
# next it filters them by set threshold
# next step is to create a graph object in which genes are nodes and the presence of correlation above the threshold is an edge between them
# this graph is used to identify highly connected gene groups with parameters passed to RBGL::highlyConnSG
# finally gene groups are filtered to consist of some minimal number of genes
